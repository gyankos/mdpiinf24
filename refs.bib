ABSTRACT = {Current specification mining algorithms for temporal data rely on exhaustive search approaches, which become detrimental in real data settings where a plethora of distinct temporal behaviours are recorded over prolonged observations. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, Bolt2, based on a refined heuristic search of our previous algorithm, Bolt. Our experiments show that the proposed approach not only surpasses exhaustive search methods in terms of running time but also guarantees a minimal description that captures the overall temporal behaviour. This is achieved through a hypothesis lattice search that exploits support metrics. Our novel specification mining algorithm also outperforms the results achieved in our previous contribution.},

abstract = {Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class-interface extractor. This book is your ticket to becoming a parsing guru!What You Need: ANTLR 4.0 and above. Java development tools. Ant build system optional (needed for building ANTLR from source)}

Without resorting to the concepts of bound variables and quantifiers SEQUEL identifies a set of simple operations on tabular structures, which can be shown to be of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus. A SEQUEL user is presented with a consistent set of keyword English templates which reflect how people use tables to obtain information. Moreover, the SEQUEL user is able to compose these basic templates in a structured manner in order to form more complex queries. SEQUEL is intended as a data base sublanguage for both the professional programmer and the more infrequent data base user.},

abstract = {Frequent pattern mining is a popular technique in big data mining and analytics. It discovers frequently occurring sets of items (e.g., popular merchandise items, frequently co-occurring events) from big data found in numerous database engineered applications. These frequent patterns can be discovered horizontally by transaction-centric mining algorithms or vertically by item-centric mining algorithms. Regardless of their mining direction (horizontal or vertical), traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms aim to discover Boolean frequent patterns in the sense that patterns capture the presence (or absence) of items within the discovered patterns. However, there are many real-life situations, in which quantities of items within the patterns are important. For example, the quantity of items may also affect profits of selling the items within the discovered patterns. Hence, in this paper, we present an algorithm for vertical mining of interesting quantitative frequent patterns. This Q-Eclat algorithm first represents the big data as a collection of equivalence classes according to their prefix item labels. Each domain item is represented by one of these classes. Their corresponding item-centric sets capture (a) IDs of transactions containing the item, as well as (b) the quantity of that item in each transaction. With this representation, our algorithm then vertically mines quantitative frequent patterns. When compared the existing MQA-M algorithm (which was built for quantitative horizontal frequent pattern mining), evaluation results show that our quantitative vertical Q-Eclat algorithm takes shorter runtime to mine quantitative frequent patterns.},

abstract = {We show that existing mature, relational optimizers can be exploited with a novel schema to give better performance for property graph storage and retrieval than popular noSQL graph stores. The schema combines relational storage for adjacency information with JSON storage for vertex and edge attributes. We demonstrate that this particular schema design has benefits compared to a purely relational or purely JSON solution. The query translation mechanism translates Gremlin queries with no side effects into SQL queries so that one can leverage relational query optimizers. We also conduct an empirical evaluation of our schema design and query translation mechanism with two existing popular property graph stores. We show that our system is 2-8 times better on query performance, and 10-30 times better in throughput on 4.3 billion edge graphs compared to existing stores.},

TITLE = {Quickening Data-Aware Conformance Checking through Temporal Algebras},
JOURNAL = {Information},
VOLUME = {14},

ARTICLE-NUMBER = {173},
ISSN = {2078-2489},
ABSTRACT = {A temporal model describes processes as a sequence of observable events characterised by distinguishable actions in time. Conformance checking allows these models to determine whether any sequence of temporally ordered and fully-observable events complies with their prescriptions. The latter aspect leads to Explainable and Trustworthy AI, as we can immediately assess the flaws in the recorded behaviours while suggesting any possible way to amend the wrongdoings. Recent findings on conformance checking and temporal learning lead to an interest in temporal models beyond the usual business process management community, thus including other domain areas such as Cyber Security, Industry 4.0, and e-Health. As current technologies for accessing this are purely formal and not ready for the real world returning large data volumes, the need to improve existing conformance checking and temporal model mining algorithms to make Explainable and Trustworthy AI more efficient and competitive is increasingly pressing. To effectively meet such demands, this paper offers KnoBAB, a novel business process management system for efficient Conformance Checking computations performed on top of a customised relational model. This architecture was implemented from scratch after following common practices in the design of relational database management systems. After defining our proposed temporal algebra for temporal queries (xtLTLf), we show that this can express existing temporal languages over finite and non-empty traces such as LTLf. This paper also proposes a parallelisation strategy for such queries, thus reducing conformance checking into an embarrassingly parallel problem leading to super-linear speed up. This paper also presents how a single xtLTLf operator (or even entire sub-expressions) might be efficiently implemented via different algorithms, thus paving the way to future algorithmic improvements. Finally, our benchmarks highlight that our proposed implementation of xtLTLf (KnoBAB) outperforms state-of-the-art conformance checking software running on LTLf logic.}

abstract="We propose a real-time, Realizable, Responsive, Unobtrusive Unit (rt-R2U2) to meet the emerging needs for System Health Management (SHM) of new safety-critical embedded systems like automated vehicles, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), or small satellites. SHM for these systems must be able to handle unexpected situations and adapt specifications quickly during flight testing between closely-timed consecutive missions, not mid-mission, necessitating fast reconfiguration. They must enable more advanced probabilistic reasoning for diagnostics and prognostics while running aboard limited hardware without affecting the certified on-board software. We define and prove correct translations of two real-time projections of Linear Temporal Logic to two types of efficient observer algorithms to continuously assess the status of the system. A synchronous observer yields an instant abstraction of the satisfaction check, whereas an asynchronous observer concretizes this abstraction at a later, a priori known, time. By feeding the system's real-time status into a statistical reasoning unit, e.g., based on Bayesian networks, we enable advanced health estimation and diagnosis. We experimentally demonstrate our novel framework on real flight data from NASA's Swift UAS. By on-boarding rt-R2U2 aboard an existing FPGA already built into the standard UAS design and seamlessly intercepting sensor values through read-only observations of the system bus, we avoid system integration problems of software instrumentation or added hardware. The flexibility of our approach with regard to changes in the monitored specification is not due to the reconfigurability offered by FPGAs; it is a benefit of the modularity of our observers and would also be available on non-reconfigurable hardware platforms such as ASICs.",

	abstract="Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchains that automatically execute when some conditions are verified to satisfy the terms of an agreement. They are usually programmed in procedural languages even if some recent proposals use logic for their specification and verification. However, existing logic-based initiatives only enable the formal checking of properties of a single smart contract independently from the other smart contracts running on the same blockchain. This paper proposes a framework, called SCRea, that works on a set of smart contracts encoded in Linear Temporal Logics. SCRea can work offline or at runtime to verify whether the execution of each smart contract is compatible with the execution of the others and, in case, provides a particular order of execution ensuring that the preconditions of each smart contract are verified before its execution.",

@article{ltlfnfa, title={Reasoning on LTL on Finite Traces: Insensitivity to Infiniteness}, volume={28}, abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; In this paper we study when an LTL formula on finite traces (LTLf formula) is insensitive to infiniteness, that is, it can be correctly handled as a formula on infinite traces under the assumption that at a certain point the infinite trace starts repeating an end event forever, trivializing all other propositions to false. This intuition has been put forward and (wrongly) assumed to hold in general in the literature. We define a necessary and sufficient condition to characterize whether an LTLf formula is insensitive to infiniteness, which can be automatically checked by any LTL reasoner. Then, we show that typical LTLf specification patterns used in process and service modeling in CS, as well as trajectory constraints in Planning and transition-based LTLf specifications of action domains in KR, are indeed very often insensitive to infiniteness. This may help to explain why the assumption of interpreting LTL on finite and on infinite traces has been (wrongly) blurred. Possibly because of this blurring, virtually all literature detours to Buechi automata for constructing the NFA that accepts the traces satisfying an LTLf formula. As a further contribution, we give a simple direct algorithm for computing such NFA. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={AAAI}, author={De Giacomo, Giuseppe and De Masellis, Riccardo and Montali, Marco}, year={2014}, month={Jun.} }

	abstract = {The fuzzy time series (FTS) model is widely used to forecast time series data. However, the predicted results of FTS are poor for industrial time series data, especially when data changes rapidly and its volume is enormous. Therefore, a dynamic soft sensor model is proposed based on propositional linear temporal logic (PLTL) with a sliding window. First, the sliding window is used to extract dynamic data. Then the extracted data is modeled by FTS to generate an initial forecasting result. Finally, according to the data in the window, a PLTL formula is generated to describe the trend of the data. The generated formula is used as a formal label of the data in the window to weight the initial forecasting result. The proposed method is verified with the TAIEX data set. Analysis of variance is used to test the significance of selected data sets. The experimental results prove that the new method has good regression forecasting performance. Finally, an example of industrial application is introduced. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model for industrial time series data.}

	abstract="Process mining techniques often reveal that real-life processes are more variable than anticipated. Although declarative process models are more suitable for less structured processes, most discovery techniques generate conventional procedural models. In this paper, we focus on discovering Declare models based on event logs. A Declare model is composed of temporal constraints. Despite the suitability of declarative process models for less structured processes, their discovery is far from trivial. Even for smaller processes there are many potential constraints. Moreover, there may be many constraints that are trivially true and that do not characterize the process well. Naively checking all possible constraints is computationally intractable and may lead to models with an excessive number of constraints. Therefore, we have developed an Apriori algorithm to reduce the search space. Moreover, we use new metrics to prune the model. As a result, we can quickly generate understandable Declare models for real-life event logs.",

Here, we look at declarative process specifications expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf). We provide a sound and complete technique to synthesize the alignment instructions relying on finite automata theoretic manipulations. Such a technique can be effectively implemented by using planning technology. Notably, the resulting planning-based alignment system significantly outperforms all current state-of-the-art ad-hoc alignment systems. We report an in-depth experimental study that supports this claim.},

  title={Discovering Declarative Process Model Behavior from Event Logs via Model Learning},

  year={2021},

  volume={},

  number={},

  pages={48-55},

  abstract={Declarative business process (BP) models define the behavior of BPs as a set of temporal constraints, which can be summarized as a deterministic finite state automaton (DFA). Declarative BP discovery aims at inferring such constraints from event logs. To this aim, it requires as additional input the set of candidate constraints to be verified with respect to the event log. Intuitively, this restricts the discovery task to a conformance checking activity between a predefined set of constraint templates and an event log, preventing to learn any observed behavior that is not captured by those templates. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage Model Learning (ML) for the automated discovery of the DFA underlying the behavior of a declarative BP model, without using any further a-priori information in addition to the event log. To assess the quality of the discovered DFA, we introduce a novel definition of the standard process mining quality metrics, i.e., precision, generalization and simplicity, tailored to DFAs. Finally, a preliminary evaluation performed with real-life logs shows that ML enables to generate extremely simpler DFAs than state-of-the-art BP declarative discovery techniques, keeping similar values of precision and generalization.},

@article{ltlfnfa, title={Reasoning on LTL on Finite Traces: Insensitivity to Infiniteness}, volume={28}, abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; In this paper we study when an LTL formula on finite traces (LTLf formula) is insensitive to infiniteness, that is, it can be correctly handled as a formula on infinite traces under the assumption that at a certain point the infinite trace starts repeating an end event forever, trivializing all other propositions to false. This intuition has been put forward and (wrongly) assumed to hold in general in the literature. We define a necessary and sufficient condition to characterize whether an LTLf formula is insensitive to infiniteness, which can be automatically checked by any LTL reasoner. Then, we show that typical LTLf specification patterns used in process and service modeling in CS, as well as trajectory constraints in Planning and transition-based LTLf specifications of action domains in KR, are indeed very often insensitive to infiniteness. This may help to explain why the assumption of interpreting LTL on finite and on infinite traces has been (wrongly) blurred. Possibly because of this blurring, virtually all literature detours to Buechi automata for constructing the NFA that accepts the traces satisfying an LTLf formula. As a further contribution, we give a simple direct algorithm for computing such NFA. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={AAAI}, author={De Giacomo, Giuseppe and De Masellis, Riccardo and Montali, Marco}, year={2014}, month={Jun.} }

However, current process mining studies in healthcare pay more attention to the control flow of events, while the data properties and the time perspective are generally ignored. Moreover, classifying event attributes from the view of computers usually are difficult for medical experts. There are also problems of model sharing and reusing after it is generated.},

	abstract="Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchains that automatically execute when some conditions are verified to satisfy the terms of an agreement. They are usually programmed in procedural languages even if some recent proposals use logic for their specification and verification. However, existing logic-based initiatives only enable the formal checking of properties of a single smart contract independently from the other smart contracts running on the same blockchain. This paper proposes a framework, called SCRea, that works on a set of smart contracts encoded in Linear Temporal Logics. SCRea can work offline or at runtime to verify whether the execution of each smart contract is compatible with the execution of the others and, in case, provides a particular order of execution ensuring that the preconditions of each smart contract are verified before its execution.",
